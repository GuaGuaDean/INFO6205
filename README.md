In this Homework we are asked to build a console client app and find the relationship between the number of pairs generated to accomplish reducing the number of components from n to 1 is proportional 1/2 n log n where log n is the natural logarithm of n.

By reading system input, we can have user interface like this

Please input the number of sites: 

After trying few numbers as initial isolated sites, 

Please input the number of sites: 10  
The result of n*log(n)/2 is: 11.51292546497023  
The average number of pair generated to combine 10 isolated sites is 16

Please input the number of sites: 100  
The result of n*log(n)/2 is: 230.25850929940458  
The average number of pair generated to combine 100 isolated sites is 263

Please input the number of sites: 1000  
The result of n*log(n)/2 is: 3453.8776394910683  
The average number of pair generated to combine 1000 isolated sites is 3756

Please input the number of sites: 10000  
The result of n*log(n)/2 is: 46051.701859880915  
The average number of pair generated to combine 10000 isolated sites is 48798

Please input the number of sites: 100000  
The result of n*log(n)/2 is: 575646.2732485115  
The average number of pair generated to combine 100000 isolated sites is 605998

We can find that average number of pair generated very close to 1/2 nlog(n). 

That's it,
